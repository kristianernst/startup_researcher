# Startup Researcher Frontend

A compact Next.js app that renders the monthly startup funding digest generated by the research flows.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+ (or any compatible package manager)

## Install & Run
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The dev server defaults to <http://localhost:3000>.

## Data sources
The UI tries to load deal data in the following order:
1. Path configured via the `DIGEST_PATH` environment variable (relative paths resolve from `frontend/`).
2. `../data/reports/condensed_research.json` â€“ matches the backend output location.
3. The baked-in sample at `frontend/data/digest.json`.

This makes it easy to iterate with the sample file, while picking up fresh research runs automatically once they exist.

## Building
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Editing notes
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and design tokens live in `globals.css`.
- Page-level logic is in `app/page.tsx`. Server components fetch data via `lib/getDigest.ts`.
- Client-only tweaks (e.g. hydration fixes) live in `app/ClientBody.tsx`.
