idea: start researching and building the backend for researching and collecting news on startup companies and output a report of the news.


first use case: 

Start of each month, we look back and collect a list of the Previous month's startup funding news.

That means, we need to collect information of startup companies and their funding news.


many ways of going about this:
1) track news channels and collect information over time (could be gaps in information, and some a limited by paywalls and subscriptions)
2) use deepresearch agents to collect wanted information (could be gaps in information). Exa, Openai, Perplexity seem like good options.
3) track all companies (hard because we dont know all companies)

Not sure exactly which one is best.
